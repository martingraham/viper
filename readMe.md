# Viper

Viper is Java-based visualisation software for exploring and eliminating mismatches in genotype pedigree data, built in collaboration between Edinburgh Napier University and the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, and funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (www.bbsrc.ac.uk)

Load in separate pedigree and genotype files, see the errors and then remove them by iteratively removing markers, masking data points and breaking pedigree relations. Expert pedigree analysts will be able to do this while masking fewer data points than an automated process eliminates.

Full instructions and demo data sets are available here on the Roslin website: http://bioinformatics.roslin.ac.uk/viper/
